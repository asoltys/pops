          | Risk assessments start off very simple, using a minimum of data, making simple assumptions and using simple calculations. At this initial stage, all assumptions should err on the side of caution. If the earliest iterations of the risk assessment predicts elevated risk, it doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that there is elevated risk, but additional work needs to be done to refine the risk assessment. In Canada, the earliest iteration is called a Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (PQRA) (Health Canada 2004). Subsequent refinements are often called Detailed Site-Specific Risk Assessments.
